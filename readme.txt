<h3>What is SafePassword.net Login Security service</h3>

It’s an authentication system that generates really strong, safe and temporary passwords, example: #B$53f5@.
- Strong: It would take 9 hours to someone to hack it and the time you have for using it, is only 10 minutes.
- Temporary: Once you log in, the password auto-destroys.
- Safe: You have 3 tries, after these your password expires and you would have to request another one.
- Reliable: You don’t need to worry about SafePassword.net Login Security service shutting down, it’s hosted on Amazon servers.

<h3>How it works</h3>

In the moment that you connect your site with SafePassword.net Login Security service, everyone (users & admins ) will have the option to choose between logging in with their usual password, or with SafePassword Login Security.
And so, if someone tries to break one of your user’s password, it will be almost impossible, because there will be no more passwords (if logging in with SafePassword Login Security is enabled)
For logging in in your wp-admin dashboard, you just have to go to your website login area and request your SafePassword. As simple as logging in everywhere else.

<h3>Why is it almost impossible to crack a SafePassword?</h3>

- Our generated passwords contain 8 random characters that are randomly chosen between 94 different characters (111 billion combinations).
- To crack one of our passwords, someone should guess the password in maximum 3 attempts, or else it will auto-destroy.
- As said before, it would take ±9 hours to crack one of our passwords, and the hacker has a window of time of 10 minutes after which the password expires.
- Beyond all of these things, that someone should also guess the moment when you’re trying to connect (which is almost impossible), and use your password before you.
